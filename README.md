# Advent of Code 2015–

Here all solved puzzles for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) are kept for reference. Most solutions are written in **Python**, but there are also solutions written in **Elixir**.

* 2016–2020 are squashed in version control, so the original thoughts/rants about the solution are forgotten for future generations.
* 2021 onwards will have each solution as a separate commit.
